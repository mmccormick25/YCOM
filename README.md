This project is a 2D recreation/reimagining of the 3D turn based XCOM 2 game.

Running the Game:
After downloading and extracting the projet, run the Main.java file in the src folder.

Goal:
Defeat the enemies in all three levels. 
WARNING: This is not easy!

How to Play:
On each turn of the game, you will move and shoot with all of your soldiers, then the enemy will move and shoot with all of their soldiers. To start your turn, select
your soldier on the blue team that you want to move, which will highlight them. Once you select a soldier, you must move them before selecting another soldier. 
Now click the move button. From there, select the tile that you want to move to. 
After that, you can either move again, or shoot. Once you shoot, the chance of you hitting a red enemy will appear above their sprite. Select
the enemy that you want to shoot. If you hit an enemy, their health bar above will go down. Shooting will end the character's turn, making them turn grey. 
Select your other soldiers and repeat this process. After you move all your soldiers the enemy will move and shoot. Currently only the move and shoot buttons are working,
and the others are for future updates.

Tips:
Your accuracy depends on the distance you are an enemy, and if there are rocks in the path of your shot. You also can't shoot through red walls
unless your character is standing right next to them. Try to keep your soldiers in cover to dodge enemy fire! Position your soldiers based on
the type of weapon they have for the best chance of winning.
